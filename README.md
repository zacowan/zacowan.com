My portfolio site. This has been re-written several times (once even in svelte), but this is the final resting place of the portfolio.

This was generated from [this template](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) because it seemed minimal and reasonable.

## Getting Started

### Corepack

This project uses [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) to provide a consistent package manager experience. Until corepack is enabled by default, you'll need to manually enable corepack:

```sh
corepack enable
```

Once enabled, corepack will automatically begin to work.

### Local Development

1. Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pnpm i
```

2. Run the local dev server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```
