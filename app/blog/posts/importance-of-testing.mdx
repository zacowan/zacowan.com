title: Reflecting on the Importance of Testing & Software Longevity

I think everyone can think of a time in their career in software that goes something like this:

- Code a new feature
- Manually validate that the new feature works
- Write tests for the new feature to meet testing requirements
- ...repeat

This was certainly me for much of my early days in my full-time career - an immense focus on "move fast and break things", and then sprinkling in some tests for good measure. Testing has often been an afterthought for me, something to do once I was confident that everything was going to work. And as I did the tests, there was no thought behind the testing - I just did them because I had to.

As I approach 2 years of working full-time on software, I've experienced a distinct shift in how I perceive software testing and its impact. Testing is no longer this meaningless requirement that _might_ ensure that my code is correct. Instead, testing has grown into this amazing developer experience tool - one that tells my team how my code works, one that gives me the confidence to make changes, and one that helps automate tedious, manual tasks.

## Conclusion

I hope I've illustrated above why testing has many benefits beyond just "validating code works", including: documenting expected behavior, giving developers the confidence to make changes, and auotmating validation tasks.

As a developer that likes to move fast, a top-notch developer experience is something I'm always on the lookout for. I've always believed that good developer experience meant a solid CI/CD pipeline, fast development environments, solid dependency management, and monorepos for interconnected packages (can you tell I work in TypeScript a lot). Nowadays, I'd like to expand my personal definition to include robust testing, as testing has really shown itself to be a powerful addition to a good developer experience. I hope you do to.
